### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, 

I discovered my passion of Data Science and Machine Learning during my masterâ€™s degree and since then Iâ€™ve been striving to improve my existing skills and gain new ones.<br>
I enjoy working with data, analyzing and visualizing it, as well as building models and I believe what I like most is the interdisciplinarity of the field as well as the fact that it requires constant attention, organization, adaptability, critical thinking and a touch of creativity.<br> 
Professional skills:<br>
Python and its libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, NLTK and SpaCy, Regular Expressions, HTML & CSS, SQL.
